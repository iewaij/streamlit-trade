# streamlit-trader

Algorithmic trade with the power of streamlit. Take advantage of streamlit and altair to create visually appealing algo trade app. Currently this project is a proof of concept and I'm trying to write trading strategies/classes from scratch. I will also explore the possiblity to incorporate other python backtesting/trading libraries.
